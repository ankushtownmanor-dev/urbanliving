        </div>
        <div className="section-content">
          <p>
            This section outlines the terms governing cancellations, refunds, and related financial adjustments. Because cancellations directly affect both guests and hosts, this policy is designed to ensure transparency and fairness.
          </p>
          
          <h3>8.1 General Refund Principles</h3>
          <p>Refund eligibility is determined by a combination of factors, including:</p>
          <ul className="list-style">
            <li>The cancellation policy selected or applied by the host</li>
            <li>The timing of the cancellation relative to the check-in date</li>
            <li>The type and nature of the booking (refundable, partially refundable, non-refundable, etc.)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The Platform facilitates refund processing but does not independently approve or deny refunds, except where required by applicable law, Platform policies, or in cases involving misuse, fraud, or safety concerns.
          </p>

          <h3>8.2 Guest-Initiated Cancellations</h3>
          <p>Refunds for cancellations made by guests depend on the specific policy displayed on the listing or booking confirmation page. These may include:</p>
          <ul className="list-style">
            <li><strong>Free Cancellation Window:</strong> A full or partial refund may be issued if the booking is cancelled within the permitted free-cancellation period.</li>
            <li><strong>Partial Refund:</strong> Guests may receive a reduced refund based on how close to the check-in date the cancellation occurs. The applicable percentage is defined in the listing's cancellation terms.</li>
            <li><strong>Non-Refundable Bookings:</strong> Some bookings are fully non-refundable once confirmed. In such cases, no refund will be issued regardless of the cancellation timing.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><em>Additional Notes:</em> Service fees, convenience charges, or payment gateway fees may be non-refundable, unless explicitly stated otherwise or mandated by law.</p>

          <h3>8.3 Host-Initiated Cancellations</h3>
          <p>If a host cancels a confirmed booking:</p>
          <ul className="list-style">
            <li>The guest will receive a full refund, including applicable service charges</li>
            <li>The Platform may assist the guest in arranging alternative accommodation, subject to availability</li>
            <li>Hosts who frequently cancel confirmed bookings may be subject to penalties, reduced listing visibility, or temporary/permanent account suspension</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>8.4 No-Shows & Early Check-Out</h3>
          <ul className="list-style">
            <li>Guests who fail to check in ("no-show") are not eligible for a refund, unless the host's policy explicitly allows otherwise</li>
            <li>Early check-outs generally do not qualify for refunds, except where permitted under the host's terms or in approved exceptional circumstances</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>8.5 Refund Processing Timeline</h3>
          <ul className="list-style">
            <li>Once a refund is approved, it will be initiated through PayU, the payment gateway handling the original transaction</li>
            <li>Refunds typically reflect in the guest's account within 5–10 business days, depending on the payment method, issuing bank, and settlement cycles</li>
            <li>Delays caused by banks or third-party systems are outside the Platform's control</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>8.6 Exceptional Circumstances</h3>
          <p>Refunds or partial refunds may be considered under exceptional or unavoidable circumstances such as:</p>
          <ul className="list-style">
            <li>Government-imposed restrictions or travel bans</li>
            <li>Natural disasters, severe weather conditions, or public emergencies</li>
            <li>Legal orders, safety concerns, or conditions making the stay impossible or unsafe</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Such situations are evaluated case-by-case, and supporting documentation may be required to assess eligibility.</p>
